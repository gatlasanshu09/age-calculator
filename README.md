# age-calculator
Develop a Python script that calculates and lists all possible time intervals, including minutes, hours, days, months, and years, between two input date and time values. This versatile tool provides a comprehensive overview of temporal differences, aiding users in various applications such as scheduling, event planning, and data analysis. The script employs datetime functionality to ensure accuracy and flexibility in handling diverse time spans. Users can input two date-time pairs, and the script will output a detailed breakdown of the time intervals in each unit. Upload this utility to GitHub for easy sharing and collaboration, enabling others to benefit from its functionality in time-related calculations and applications.
